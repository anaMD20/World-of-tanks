# World-of-tanks

I implemented the scene of a game similar to World of Tanks. Practically, in my implementation you can find the movement of the tank front-back, left-right plus the rotation of its turret. I also put three enemies that move along a defined trajectory and buildings that appear randomly in different areas of the stage.
